# School Management System (Java - OOP)

This is a **console-based Java program** that demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, objects, static methods, and encapsulation. The program models a school money management system, tracking student fees, teacher salaries, and the school's finances. I completed this program as an individual project that I did to learn the OOP concepts in my 1st year studies
